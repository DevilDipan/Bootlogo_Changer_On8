# Bootlogo Changer On8
 Based on some previous works done by my dev friends on xda.
 This is bootlogo changer for On8 or BootScreen Changer for On8 this would 
 NOT work on any other phone, without modifications and dont use it without any knowledge of this as it can
 and will brick your phone but it will work on any other phones of same resoultion but,
 non-treble phones(not tested on treble devices if ever tested please inform me).
